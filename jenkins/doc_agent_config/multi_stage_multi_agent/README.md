# Multi Stage Multi Agent
Set up a multi stage jenkins pipeline where each stage is run on a unique agent. This is a very useful approach when you have multi language application or application that has conflicting dependencies.


For testing multiple agent add script path - jenkins/doc_agent_config /multi_stage_multi_agent/jenkinsfile
